The steps to add logos to the filters that appear in J-Hero are as follows, for the purpose of this tutorial the desktop theme I will be using will be the Classic theme and the version of Playnite I am using while writing this is version 10.32.

1) Open up your add-on browser by pressing the F9 key, or by clicking on the Playnite button at the top left and then "add-ons.

2) Go to your "Installed" tab, expand it and go to "Themes Fullscreen", then select J-Hero and on the right hand side select the link to "Installation Folder".

3) Then locate and open the "Icons" folder.

4) Again, locate and open the folder named "Filter".

5) In this folder you will find a number of images these are the logos that can be used for filters while using J-Hero.

6) If you want to add a logo that doesn't exist (i.e. Sega Saturn) to do this you would drop the image file you want to use in this folder with the name you apply to your filter (i.e. Sega Saturn.png).

7) Once you have done this, you want to go back to Playnite and create a filter and save it.

8) You will then need to name the filter the same as the picture without the file type, so we want to enter "Sega Saturn" because our file name is "Sega Saturn.png", also ensure "Show as quick filter in Fullscreen mode" is checked.

9) After clicking save you should be good to go! Launching Fullscreen mode should show the filter as a picture instead of the text now.

Hope this helps with setting up pictures as filters!
