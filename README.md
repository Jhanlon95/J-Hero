# J-Hero

This is a further mod of McHero by seannuh. Tweaked to how I would like things to be laid out, mainly planning on using it for my Steam Deck

It is also possible to add logos to the filter tabs by following this guide - https://github.com/Jhanlon95/J-Hero/blob/main/Adding%20logos%20to%20filters.md
