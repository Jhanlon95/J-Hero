The steps to add logos to the filters that appear in J-Hero are as follows, for the purpose of this tutorial the desktop theme I will be using will be the Classic theme and the version of Playnite I am using while writing this is version 10.32. I will also add pictures where possible

1) Locate your Playnite installation folder, the easiest way of doing this is in Desktop mode, press the F1 key and then click the link to take you to "User data directory"

2) You will then want to locate the "Themes" folder when your Windows Explorer opens

3) Once inside this folder go to "Fullscreen"

4) Locate and open the folder for J-Hero

5) Then locate and open the "Icons" folder

6) Again, locate and open the folder named "Filter"

7) In this folder you will find a number of images these are the logos that can be used for filters while using J-Hero

9) If you want to add a logo that doesn't exist (i.e. Sega Saturn) to do this you would drop the image file you want to use in this folder with the name you apply to your filter (i.e. Sega Saturn.png

10) Once you have done this, you want to go back to Playnite and create a filter and save it

11) You will then need to name the filter the same as the picture without the file type, so we want "Sega Saturn" because our file name is "Sega Saturn.png". You also want to ensure "Show as quick filter in Fullscreen mode" is checked
    ![image](https://github.com/Jhanlon95/J-Hero/assets/11045596/1a8b1059-2083-4adb-8dd7-4caa94cf9e85)
12) After clicking save you should be good to go! Launching Fullscreen mode should show the filter as a picture instead of the text now

Hope this helps with setting up pifctures as filters!
